# Attribute Analyzer
## How It Works:

Welcome to the Attributes Analyzer! This tool utilizes a Keras model based on the ResNet50 architecture, a powerful deep neural network commonly employed in image classification tasks. The model, trained on a diverse dataset of celebrity faces, is designed to analyze facial attributes when presented with a photo of a person.

## Key Features:

- **ResNet50 Architecture:** The backbone of the model is ResNet50, known for its effectiveness in image analysis. It's a deep neural network structure that allows for accurate and detailed attribute predictions.

- **Machine Learning Insights:** The model, driven by machine learning techniques, achieves an 85% accuracy rate. This means it can reliably predict various attributes based on the facial features it recognizes.

## Important Note:

While the Attributes Analyzer is a fascinating exploration into machine learning and image classification, it's important to note its experimental nature. The model excels in analyzing celebrity faces, but predictions may vary when applied to other types of images. Feel free to dive into the intricacies of facial attribute prediction and explore the capabilities of our tool!

*Disclaimer: This tool is designed for educational purposes and experimentation. Predictions may not be accurate for all types of images, as the model is specifically trained on celebrity faces.*
